Never fear, for there are many more magical crops out there for you to cook with! My personal favorite is Mandrake root, a plant any witch worth their ritual salt should be familar with. "

Its innate chaotic magic can also be of your benefit, as it can amplify the latent magic power in many other substances without needing complex enchantments. For beginners or for those who have misplaced their introductory arcane textbooks, I have included a diagram of the creation of mandrake seeds on the next page. An enchantment this simple can be done on any old workbench."
